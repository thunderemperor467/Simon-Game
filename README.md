🎮 Just Built a Fun Game – Simon Says! 🎮

Hey LinkedIn fam!
I’m excited to share a mini project I recently built — the classic Simon Says Game 🟢🔴🔵🟡

After learning HTML and CSS, I’ve now started diving into JavaScript, and this game was my way of practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and a bit of logic building. 🙌

🛠️ What it does:
The game lights up a sequence of colors and you have to repeat the exact pattern. Each level adds a new color to the sequence — and if you mess up… back to level 1! 😅

🎯 It was a great way to test my JS basics while also having some fun with code. The UI is kept simple, because this was more about understanding how JavaScript works under the hood.

If you’ve just started with JavaScript, I totally recommend trying this — it’s both a brain teaser and a great learning tool! 🧠💻

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions to improve it!
Let’s keep learning and building 🚀
